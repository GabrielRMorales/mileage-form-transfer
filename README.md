# mileage-form-transfer
This transfers the data from a specific mileage form made in Google Sheets to a specific mileage form made in Microsoft Word.

It requires the csv and docx modules. The mileage forms are specifically formatted, so usage is narrow in scope.

Save the Google Sheets file as a csv file. Name it "miles.csv"

Name the Word mileage file, "Mileage_Template.docx."

Both of these files should be in the same directory and level as mile_app.py.

Run mile_app.py and the output file will be "Completed_Mileage.docx"
